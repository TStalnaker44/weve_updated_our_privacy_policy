But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive </span> any <span class='replacement'> other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to </span> share <span class='replacement'> this information themselves). </span> Information collected by these <span class='replacement'> third-party </span> services is subject to their own terms and <span class='replacement'> policies, not this one. </p> <p>Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you. </p> <p><em>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so </span> that <span class='replacement'> in the next version, we will reduce the data </span> that <span class='replacement'> an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.</em></p> </span> <p>New owner.</p> <p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our <span class='replacement'> Products </span> or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. </p> <p>Sharing <span class='replacement'> with </span> Third-Party <span class='replacement'> Partners</p> </span> <p>We work with <span class='replacement'> third-party partners </span> who help us provide and improve our <span class='replacement'> Products </span> or who use <span class='replacement'> Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, </span> which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. <span class='replacement'> We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here </span> are the types of third parties we <span class='deletion'> </span> share information <span class='replacement'> with: </p> <p>Partners who use our analytics services.</p> </span> <p>We <span class='replacement'> provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, </span> as <span class='replacement'> well </span> as <span class='replacement'> aggregate demographic and </span> other information <span class='replacement'> that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account. </p> <p>Advertisers.</p> <p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't </span> share information that personally identifies you <span class='replacement'> (information such as your </span> name or email address that <span class='deletion'> </span> by itself <span class='addition'> can </span> be used to contact you or identifies who you are) <span class='deletion'> </span> unless you give us permission. <span class='deletion'> </span> For example, we <span class='replacement'> provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that </span> an <span class='replacement'> ad was seen by a woman between the ages of </span> 25 <span class='replacement'> and 34 </span> who <span class='addition'> lives in Madrid and </span> likes software engineering) to <span class='deletion'> </span> help them <span class='addition'> better </span> understand their <span class='replacement'> audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser. </p> <p>Measurement partners.</p> <p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners. </p> <p>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</p> <p>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details. </p> <p>Vendors and service providers.</p> <p>We provide information and content to vendors and </span> service providers <span class='deletion'> </span> who <span class='deletion'> </span> support our business, such as <span class='addition'> by </span> providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our <span class='replacement'> Products </span> are used, <span class='deletion'> </span> providing customer service, facilitating <span class='replacement'> payments </span> or conducting <span class='replacement'> surveys. </p> <p>Researchers and academics.</p> <p>We also provide information and content to </span> research <span class='deletion'> </span> partners <span class='replacement'> and <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.fb.com%2Fprograms%2F&amp;h=AT32UhEzyjS7KTDrfi6erWpXX-3qqleiItdivlJdPa9YohHR12kn1K0j13YAStiGxMXb1-s8_9V9qXXJzpbsuHUBgXYw645xwlI2U8BWoVHzU1i3aD_Hu1zLAQBkIwQgUPMINfaAkHhRkgUk-vByCQuynyg5OBKJafQ">academics</a> to conduct research </span> that <span class='replacement'> advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. </p> <p>Law enforcement or legal requests.</p> <p>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below. </p> <p>Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings">Facebook Settings</a> and <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Faccounts%2Fprivacy_and_security%2F&amp;h=AT04RxRvOuGMF2Wm31OGxeKj2GOE93JiQDhHj8YTAQdUBGLwGQW46UQ8K6p4fnMT5h8baq9qljiq-C7jGVYk6mhjO7hQGI60QrzzN-5P09v53QhFK90EpCkpB4mHMWQAD8XbBE9tN4_ghTjTtcm9Vg">Instagram Settings</a>. </p> <h3>How do the Facebook Companies work together?</h3> <p>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=dp">Facebook Companies</a> (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, </span> consistent <span class='replacement'> and safe experience across all <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=dp">Facebook Company Products</a> you use. We also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products. </span> </p> <h3>How can I manage or delete information about me?</h3> <span class='replacement'> <p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.

This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission.
